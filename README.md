# üçú Danny's Diner SQL Case Study

This project analyzes sales data for **Danny‚Äôs Diner** using SQL.  
The goal is to answer key business questions about customer behavior and spending.

---

## üìñ Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent, and which menu items are their favourites.  

Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.  

He plans on using these insights to help decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.  

Danny has provided a **sample of his overall customer data** due to privacy issues ‚Äî but he hopes these examples are enough to write fully functioning SQL queries to answer his questions!
